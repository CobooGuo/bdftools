This is a collection of simple command line tools I have modified to use for
converting the [Dina programming font][dina] between FON and BDF format.

`fnt2bdf` and `fnt2fon` are from [Wine 1.5.4][wine], and licensed under
LGPLv2.1.

`bdf2fnt` is from [bbLean Artwiz][bblean], and licensed under GPLv2.
